# The Midnight Engine

This is the c++ Marmalade build of The Midnight Engine. Used in The Lords of Midnight and Doomdark's Revenge for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle Fire, Blackberry, Windows, and OSX.

Originally developed in 1999 for [WinLom](http://www.icemark.com/winlom99/index.html "WinLom99") then ported and redeveloped for The Lords of Midnight and Doomdark's Revenge.

Developed by Chris Wild based on the original z80 code by Mike Singleton.


NOTE: Despite support finishing for [Marmalade](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com) there no longer appears to be anyway to download their system, therefore the first priority will be to get a version of the engine building in another system.
